# object-procedural-bridge
Overview of the Opb project
The goal of the object-procedural-bridge (Opb) project is to ease the pain of developing Java applications that 
communicate with an Oracle database via PL/SQL.

This is achieved, we hope, by providing:

* A library of Java code to help when working with PL/SQL and
* A translator that can generate Java code from PL/SQL package specifications.
* The generated Java code can often be used directly by JSF pages and can always be used in a JSE environment.
