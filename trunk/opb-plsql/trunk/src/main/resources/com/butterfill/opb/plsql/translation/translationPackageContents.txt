This file provides an overview of the contents of the package 
com.butterfill.opb.plsql.translation.

DatatypeMap.java
  Part of the public API, this class handles the translation of SQL types to
  JDBC and java types.

GeneratePlsqlParser.java
  Generates and compiles the parsers defined by the grammar files Plsql.g and
  PlsqlTreeParser.g. This class should only be used during development.
  i.e. Following changes to Plsql.g or PlsqlTreeParser.g 
  GeneratePlsqlParser#main(String[]) should be run to re-generate the parsers.

OpbComment.java
  Used during translation, this class parses an Opb comment and provides access
  to the elements of the comment.

OpbField.java
  Used during translation, this class represents an Opb field.
  i.e. A field created from an Opb package comment element.

OpbJava.stg
  The group of string templates used to generate a Java interface.

Plsql.g
  The grammar for PL/SQL source code. 
  GeneratePlsqlParser.java processes this file using org.antlr.Tool - 
  which generates Plsql__.g (a lexer grammar), PlsqlLexer.java, Plsql.tokens
  and PlsqlParser.java. Plsql.tokens is created in the current working directory
  (which may not be this directory) so GeneratePlsqlParser.java copies it to
  this directory before generating the PlsqlTreeParser.

PlsqlCall.java
  Used during translation, this class represents a PL/SQL call.

PlsqlCallParameter.java
  Used during translation, this class represents a PL/SQL call parameter.

PlsqlLexer.java
  Generated from Plsql.g. 
  This file has been manually edited to make it package private.

PlsqlParser.java
  Generated from Plsql.g.
  This file has been manually edited to make it package private and suppress
  "unchecked" compiler warnings.

PlsqlTranslationHelper.java
  Used during translation, this class provides translation algorithms shared by
  other classes in this package.

PlsqlTranslator.java
  Part of the public API, this class provides methods for users to translate
  PL/SQL source into Java. This class uses the ANTLR generated parsers.

PlsqlTreeParser.java
  Generated from PlsqlTreeParser.g.
  This file has been manually edited to make it package private and suppress
  "unchecked" compiler warnings.

PlsqlTreeParser.g
  The grammar for the AST created by PlsqlParser.java. 
  GeneratePlsqlParser.java processes this file using org.antlr.Tool - 
  which generates PlsqlTreeParser.java and PlsqlTreeParser.tokens.

PlsqlTreeParser.tokens
  Generated from Plsql.g.

PlsqlTreeParserSuperClass.java
  Used during translation, this class is the super class of the generated 
  PlsqlTreeParser.java. 
  This class provides methods that can be called directly by 
  PlsqlTreeParser.java (as defined in PlsqlTreeParser.g) and holds information
  that is passed to the string templates.

Plsql__.g
  Generated from Plsql.g.

datatypeMap.txt
  The default datatype mappings used by DatatypeMap.java.
